# Sapphire-Extract
This is a rewrite of Sapphire Extract previously in java. This project will extract files from various video games. Only some of the formats from java have been reimplemented. Currently implemented formats can be found in the plugins folder.

TODO: cleanup
To add a new format, place the template plugin zip under "Documents\Visual Studio 2019\Templates\ProjectTemplates"
Add a new project of the same name and select the location in the plugins subdir.
